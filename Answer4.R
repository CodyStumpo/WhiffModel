# 4.In addition to the 3 things above, weâ€™d like you to create some summary data on the entirety of the training data set.  
# For pitchers with a minimum of 50 FB in the training data set, 
# find the top five fastest FB by init_vel and list 
# the pitch, pitcher, number of pitches thrown, avg init_vel, avg X break and avg Z break for each of the pitchers in the top five.  
# Repeat this for pitchers who have thrown 50+ CB, SL and CH in the training set 
# (so 4 separate result sets w/5 pitchers in each result set).  
# Please save this result set in a csv file. 

#find top 5 fastballs

# Looked into suspicious outlier...
# Trying to trick me! Harry Doyle's Changeup shows up at 95.  
# hdoyle = train %>% filter(pitcherid==175) shows several 100 mph CH.  Faster than FB. 
# Harry Doyle is the announcer from Major League (cute) 
# Also there is no Harry Doyle in historical records
